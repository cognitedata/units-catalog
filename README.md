# Cognite Data Fusion Unit Catalog

This repository stores a comprehensive unit catalog for Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) with a focus on standardization, comprehensiveness, and consistency. The catalog is maintained in two primary JSON files:

1. `units.json`: Contains a list of units with their metadata.
2. `unitSystems.json`: Contains various unit systems and their quantities.

## Structure

### units.json

Each item in the `units.json` has the following structure:

```json
{
    "externalId": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "longName": "string",
    "symbol": "string",
    "aliasNames": ["string", ...],
    "quantity": "string",
    "conversion": {
        "multiplier": "float",
        "offset": "float"
    },
    "source": "string",
    "sourceReference": "URL"
}
```

- `externalId`: The external identifier for the unit. Its structure follows the pattern `{quantity}:{unit}` (e.g., `temperature:deg_c`), adhering to the **snake_case** convention.
- `name`: The primary name of the unit (e.g., `DEG_C`).
- `longName`: A descriptive name for the unit (e.g., `degree Celsius`).
- `symbol`: The symbol for the unit (e.g., `Â°C`).
- `aliasNames`: An array of possible **aliases** for the unit.
- `quantity`: Specifies the physical quantity the unit measures (e.g., `Temperature`).
- `conversion`: An object containing **multiplier** and **offset** values for converting between units.
- `source`: The primary source of the unit (e.g., `qudt.org`).
- `sourceReference`: A URL reference to the unit definition on an external source, if available.

### unitSystems.json

Each item in the `unitSystems.json` has the following structure:

```json
{
    "name": "string",
    "quantities": [
        {
            "name": "string",
            "unitExternalId": "string"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
- `name`: The name of the unit system (e.g., `default`, `SI`).
- `quantities`: An array containing the physical quantities and their associated units in the system.

## Validations and Tests

To ensure the integrity of the catalog, the following tests are conducted:

1. **Syntax Check**: Every unit item in `units.json` must have the specified keys.
2. **Unique IDs**: All unit `externalIds` in `units.json` must be unique.
3. **Reference Validation**: There should be no references to non-existent unit `externalIds` in `unitSystems.json`.
4. **Default Quantities**: All quantities must be present in the `unitSystems.json` for the default quantity.
5. **Consistent References**: All quantity references in `unitSystems.json` must exist in `units.json`.
6. **Unique aliases**: All pairs of (`alias` and `quantity`) must be unique, for all **aliases** in `aliasNames`.
7. **ExternalId Format**: All unit `externalIds` must follow the pattern `{quantity}:{unit}`, where both `quantity` and `unit` are in **snake_case**.
